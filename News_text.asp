	<td><p class="pNews">Hold on to your hats and prepare to be overcome with surprise and a giddy feeling of light-headedness. The site is being updated!!!</p>
	  <p class="pNews">While you clean up your lap after spitting out your tea in disbelief, let me tell you that the end is in sight, not apocalyptically but almost on the same scale.</p>
	  <p class="pNews">We ( I use the term in a royal fashion, honesty would mean that I state Roger's name only), has whipped our poverty stricken man's render farm (2 machines) into an electronic puddle of humming submission. A cruel but ultimately necessary act of machine abuse has been going on for what the National Grid officially term as 'ages'. Fear not though, the use of the planet's resources hasn't been in vain. We now may have less oxygen to breathe but who doesn't want to be starved of air when our animation is ridiculously close to being finished? Selfish people that's who…</p>
	  <p class="pNews">It's been a time intensive effort but using nothing but tiny shovels and gloved fingers we have ram jammed filled our 2 terabyte hard drives to near breaking point. Each are now bursting with a kaleidoscope of cinematic sized movie and are now awaiting but a few shots before they can be allowed to spew the lot so we can sign off the final composition.</p>
	  <p class="pNews">From there we'll try and source a company that doesn't ignore our request for further information and plan a careful trip to somewhere where digital images can be lovingly (and incredibly reasonably priced) placed onto film.</p>
	  <p class="pNews">The Soundtrack is written mostly recorded and studio time for the necessary remaining recording should be getting booked for the end of Jan 09. The foley is also in hand but to be honest until we pass on the final edit then it is on hold, we've listed the necessary effects and passed them along to a generous and experienced pro so perhaps naively we haven't allotted much time for the foley to be completed but I have a good gut feeling that it won't be an issue (Touch wood etc)</p>
	  <p class="pNews">Our 4 year (anniversary in Oct!) effort has been shaped somewhat on the desire to premiere (if selected ) our hard work at Cannes 2009 to subsequently surprise/disturb those who watch the drama with what has been achieved by the pair of us. Regardless or not we make the cut at Cannes we will be showing the movie at festivals throughout 2009 so next year is going to be interesting to say the least and we can't wait to see what kind of reaction we get…</p>
	  <p class="pNews">Roger and I are in discussion regarding what new imagery to put up on the site though as we are slightly paranoid that they could be too revealing and spoil the first viewing of the completed work.</p>

    <td width="350"> <p class="pNews">Of the two* things we accepted that we couldn&rsquo;t achieve
    to a high enough standard, the music for the animation is approaching finality and studio recording. <br>
  We have a meeting scheduled (30th Jan) with our music 
  maestro (<span class="pBold">John Laval</span>) bringing (fingers crossed) a draft of 
  the final two pieces of music for our stamp  of 
  approval.</p>
      <p class="pNews">We have been lucky enough to find someone in tune 
    (please excuse the pun) with our ideas and who can 
    complement the visuals with an aural treat.<br>
  He&rsquo;s also rounded up and trapped a gaggle of talented 
    musicians and promised them freedom if they perform his 
    score to the required standard. He&rsquo;s so far ahead of schedule 
    it&rsquo;s sickening&hellip;
  </p>

      <p class="pNews">We have included 4 draft versions of the 5 musical pieces 
  that John has written specifically for the animation for you to 
  have a quick listen to in the <span class="pBold"><a href="music.html">music</a></span> section. As a note it 
  appears that in Internet Explorer, you have to 
  click the player&rsquo;s green button twice to activate it
  so be warned (someone send Bill an email?). </p>
